# DFSLineupOptimizer

This project uses the pydfs library to generate lineups for Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) contests. Currently, it uses fantasy points per game against the player's assigned salary to determine value for each player.

## TODO

* Explore options that library provides to calculate more accurate values for players (ex. using player projections, matchups, trends, etc)
* Set up a command-line run configuration to set customizable options (ex. player salary file, site, etc.)
